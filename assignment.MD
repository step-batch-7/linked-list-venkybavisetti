# Numbers

Write a menu driven application that will aid the user in keeping track
of a list of numbers. Your application should provide the user with the following
menu

```
Main Menu
---------
(a) add a number to the end of the list
(b) add a number to the start of the list
(c) insert a number at a given position in the list
(d) add a unique item on the list at the end(if it already exists, do not insert)
(e) remove a number from the beginning of the list
(f) remove a number from the end of the list
(g) remove a number from a given position in the list
(h) remove first occurrence of a number
(i) remove all occurrences of a number
(j) clear the whole list
(k) check if a number exists in the list
(l) display the list of numbers
(m) exit

Please enter the alphabet of the operation you would like to perform
```

Each operation, upon completion returns the user back to this menu, except
for the (m) exit option which quits the program instead.
